# TwitchVotesItems

Plugin for TwitchIntegration where Twitch chat can vote for items found in chests.

## How to install

- Move the `TwitchVotesItems.dll` file inside the BepInEx `plugins\TwitchIntegration` folder
- Done!

## How to use

Make sure you have [TwitchIntegration](https://thunderstore.io/package/OrangeNote/TwitchIntegration/) so that this mod can interact with Twitch chat.  When you open a chest, a message will be sent as your Twitch user account in stream chat proposing a vote between 3 random items.  Viewers can vote by typing 1, 2, or 3 for the corresponding item.  After 20 seconds (10 second change proposed), the item will appear.

NOTE: You need to run the "tconnect" command in the console each time you launch the game.
